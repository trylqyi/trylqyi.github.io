What excites me a little about this Jerusalem Syndrome thing is that... quite possibly, it is not a disease, but rather a phenomenon. Quite possibly, it has more to do with the city and location, than with the person and/or his latent or pre-existing conditions. Quite possibly, Jerusalem has been a magnet for self-styled prophets for quite some time, a stage for the reccurrent enactment of something. It's just that one such particular nutcase from Nazareth turned out to merely be the most charismatic and written about.

As I've mentioned before, Prague is another city where I've observed (different but) similar phenomena. Though I'd think it more appropriate that it be called the Kafka Syndrome, or the Faustus Syndrome, or something along those lines. 
Curiously, Prague has for a long time been something like Second Mother Jerusalem to the Jewish diaspora. There's the oldest surviving medieval synagogue there, with stones supposedly brought from the ruins of the Jerusalem Temple. Not to mention Charles V's obsession to connect Prague with Jerusalem.

I recollect the sometimes strange and disturbing scenes in the streets and pubs at night - people often acquire impish and demon-like attributes, they change, weird synchronicities begin to take place. It's as if some evil spirits are trying to penetrate through, taking possession of just the right people. I've met there people who claim and believe they are not exactly from this world. People who see themselves as reincarnations of Prague figures from the past.

Prague in the time of Rudolf II must have been quite the freakshow spectacle of a different kind of nutcases, too - alchemists frantically looking for philosopher's stones, magicians and infuential charlatans, gypsies and circus freaks and fortune tellers and bank frauders...
The same streets and buildings still stand, and likewise, it is the same themes replaying themselves over and over.

If Jerusalem holds auditions for messiahs, Prague does for the role of Doctor Faust - just like in the Jan Svankmajer movie.

In any case, would be interesting to explore this subject from the point of the so-called object-oriented ontology and along the lines of actor-network theory, I think.
