"Without a constant misuse of language, there cannot be any discovery, any progress."
-- Paul Feyerabend.


Bergson famously defined metaphysics as ‘the science which claims to dispense with symbols’ - and must therefore adhere to an asignifying stream of thought which does not differentiate its proper object by projecting it onto discrete symbols. It is a mode of experiencing aiming to displace the categories of habitual thought, forcing one in a state similar to that induced by some tryptamine compound drugs (Terrence McKenna said of Joyce's Finnegans Wake that "you eventually get the feeling, which is the unique feeling that the Wake gives you. It’s about as close to LSD on the page as you can get because you are simultaneously many points of view, simultaneously many dramatis loci, many places in the plot and the whole thing is riddled with resonance.")

William Burroughs’ cut-up technique seems to be one example that embodies the principle of Bergson’s method. In “Introduction to Metaphysics”, Bergson writes:

"Now the image has at least this advantage, that it keeps us in the concrete. No image can replace the intuition of duration, but many diverse images, borrowed from very different orders of things, may, by the convergence of their action, direct consciousness to the precise point where there is a certain intuition to be seized. By choosing images as dissimilar as possible, we shall prevent any one of them from usurping the place of the intuition it is intended to call up, since it would then be driven away at once by its rivals. By providing that, in spite of their differences of aspect, they all require from the mind the same kind of attention, and in some sort the same degree of tension, we shall gradually accustom consciousness to a particular and clearly defined disposition — that precisely which it must adopt in order to appear to itself as it really is, without any veil."

This appears to neatly parallel said cut-up technique. In the first pages of “The Third Mind”, Burroughs explains:

"Precisely what is a dream? A certain juxtaposition of word and image. I've recently done a lot of experiments with scrapbooks. I'll read in the newspaper something that reminds me of or has relation to something I've written. I'll cut out the picture or article and paste it in a scrapbook beside the words from my book. Or I'll be walking down the street and I'll suddenly see a scene from my book and I'll photograph it and put it in a scrapbook. I've found that when preparing a page, I'll almost invariably dream that night something relating to this juxtaposition of word and image. In other words, I've been interested in precisely how word and image get around on very, very complex association lines. I do a lot of exercises in what I call time travel, in taking coordinates, such as what I photographed on the train, what I was thinking about at the time, what I was reading and what I wrote; all of this to see how completely I can project myself back to that one point in time. [...] The scrapbooks and time travel are exercises to expand consciousness, to teach me to think in association blocks rather than words. I've recently spent a little time studying hieroglyph systems, both the Egyptian and the Mayan. A whole block of associations—boonf!—like that! Words—at least the way we use them—can stand in the way of what I call nonbody experience. It's time we thought about leaving the body behind.”

Intuition, for Bergson, is above all memory - a direct leap into the immediacy of duration (as contrasted with analytical re-constitution), a broadening beyond experience and towards the concrete conditions of experience, or what Burroughs refers to as time travel above.
In Chinese, it is worth noting (since he mentions hieroglyph systems), the etymology is already contained within the pictogram, condensing information and allowing for nuance and expression of continuity - it can also be read both vertically and horizontally simultaneously, or as Burroughs puts it, “it is already cut-up”.

Further, from “The Third Mind”:

“Of course, because cut-ups make explicit a psycho-sensory process that is going on all the time anyway. Somebody is reading a newspaper, and his eye follows the column in the proper Aristotelian manner, one idea and sentence at a time. But subliminally he is reading the columns on either side and is aware of the person sitting next to him. That's a cut-up.”
